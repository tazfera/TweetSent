About:
This software was developed to collect tweets and sorts them into positive,
negative and neutral according to the sentiment or emotion expressed in it.


Using:
 - Collecting and Sorting Tweets
	a) run the webserver
		python webserver.py
	b) access with your preferred browser
		http://localhost:8888/
	c) search a term
	d) ranking the tweets (more tweets generate better results)

 - coaching your system
	a) python couch.py -p data/pos -n data/neg -m data/neu -l -b -s portuguese
	(check your arguments)

 - see your classified tweets
	a) I didn't implement a search interface to display the final results,
	   but you can access and view it using this url:
		http://localhost:8888/view?page=1&term=love
